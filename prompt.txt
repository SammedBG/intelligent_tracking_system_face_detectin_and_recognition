but it is not storing in the json file and id is not stable and it is give differenet id for same person what should i do and the id should be stable once it is assigned it should give the same id every time it should not change the id.



but it should assign id for unkown and the id should be same for the person when he leaves the camera and again come to the camere it should be remain same id it should not change and id should be unique for each person


in attribute extraction i dont want to extract age gender and other thing i dont want to extract,insted of that use cloth segmanetation means only extracy the clothing of the person and accpceroirs which are holding or how
